That's because of the idle-delay setting. To change it you'll have to alter the corresponding dconf key (and do that as the gdm user):

    switch to a VT (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+F3), login as root and run:

    su - gdm -s /bin/sh

    to switch user to gdm.

    then run:

    export $(dbus-launch)

    and set idle delay to 0 (which translates to never):

    GSETTINGS_BACKEND=dconf gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 0

    run exit or hit Ctrl+D to return to root account.

    reboot your machine or restart the display manager:

    systemctl restart gdm

I asked about this on the arch linux IRC channel, and had the following response:

<Namarrgon> smason: it's a bug in gdm
<Namarrgon> when you disabl automatic suspend in gnome it doesn't affect gdm itself

based on this, I found a relevant looking exchange: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/361275/90376

which I altered to the following commands:

sudo machinectl shell gdm@ /bin/bash
export GSETTINGS_BACKEND=dconf
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-timeout 0

This has now been running for a couple of days and my cron and other background jobs remain running over night.
