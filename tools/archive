There are two main tools. lbzip2 and pbzip2. They're essentially different implementations of bzip2 compressors. I've compared them (the output is a tidied up version but you should be able to run the commands)

cd /dev/shm  # we do all of this in RAM!
dd if=/dev/urandom of=bigfile bs=1024 count=102400

$ lbzip2 -zk bigfile
Time: 0m3.596s
Size: 105335428 

$ pbzip2 -zk bigfile
Time: 0m5.738s6
Size: 10532460
