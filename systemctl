The "proper" way to test if a service is running in a script

systemctl has an is-active subcommand for this:

systemctl is-active --quiet service

will exit with status zero if service is active, non-zero otherwise, making it ideal for scripts:

systemctl is-active --quiet service && echo Service is running
