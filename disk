"Swap not available" - I must manually "swapon" after every reboot

You have no configuration for swap in /etc/fstab. Add following line to that file:

UUID=<uuid> none   swap    sw    0       0   

You have to replace <uuid> with the uuid of your swap partition. To do that, run sudo blkid

$ sudo blkid
/dev/sda1: LABEL="System Reserved" UUID="88A0D0A1A0D09752" TYPE="ntfs" 
/dev/sda2: UUID="0620D9F920D9EFA3" TYPE="ntfs" 
/dev/sda5: UUID="c282b418-2045-4852-8789-88a44360a0bb" TYPE="ext4" 
/dev/sda6: UUID="f99c6a0c-790a-45ca-a1a9-8874f5a2999b" TYPE="ext4" 
/dev/sda7: UUID="4cc2e909-ebd1-4c72-abee-aa32035bf330" TYPE="swap"

This is a list of my partitions, and as you see, /dev/sda7 is my swap partition. So you can copy the value of UUID corresponding to your swap, omitting the quotes, and use it for your fstab file.
