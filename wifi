Command Line

Believe it or not, this isn’t as challenging as it might seem. I will demonstrate how this is done on a Ubuntu machine. For other distributions you might have to alter the location of scripts or the name.

What you will need, in order to be able to establish this connection, are the following:

   ifconfig: Enable your wireless device.
   iwlist: List the available wireless access points.
   iwconfig: Configure your wireless connection.
   dhclient: Get your IP Address via dhcp.
   wpa_supplicant: For use with WPA authentication.

Make sure you have all of the above tools onÂ¬â€  your computer before you continue. To test for this tools you can, from within your terminal window, issue the commands:

   which ifconfig
   which iwlist
   which iwconfig
   which dhclient
   which wpa_supplicant

You should see the path where each tool is installed. If you receive an error that a command is not installed you will need to install it. This should not be the case, since these are standard tools that are required for wireless networking.

Let’s take a look at how this is done when you are connecting to a non-WPA authentication-based wireless network.

Now that you have confirmed they are installed start off with the command:

ifconfig wlan0 up

Where wlan0 is the name of your wireless device (this is most often the default). The above command will bring your wireless device up so it is ready to use. The next phase is to scan for any wireless access points with the command:

iwlist wlan0 scan

From the output of the scan you should see a line (or lines) like:

ESSID: "NETWORK_NAME"

Where NETWORK_NAME is the name of an available wireless network.

Now that you have your network name (and you know it’s available) you can connect to that network with the command:

iwconfig wlan0 essid NETWORK_NAME key WIRELESS_KEY

Where NETWORK_NAME is the name of the network you want to connect to and WIRELESS_KEY is the security key for that network. NOTE: The iwconfig command defaults to HEX values for wireless keys. If you need to use ascii you have to prepend the “s” prefix to your key like so:

iwconfig wlan0 essid NETWORK_NAME key s:WIRELESS_KEY

With your connection made, you now have to get an IP address for your machine using the dhclient command like:

dhclient wlan0
