WARNING: Usually the method below is not recommended at all, but you can continue if you really want to get ScreenLets installed on your system.

We need to add Ubuntu 16.04 LTS repositories to the system:

cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/xenial.list 
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial main universe multiverse restricted
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates main universe multiverse restricted
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security main universe multiverse restricted
EOF

Then we need to install LibPNG 1.2 from linuxuprising PPA (as the regular deb-based method does not work):

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/libpng12
sudo apt install libpng12-0

Then we need to add ScreenLets PPA:

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 94E58C34A8670E8C
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/screenlets/ppa/ubuntu xenial main"

And finally we will be allowed to install ScreenLets:

sudo apt-get install screenlets-pack-all

and enjoy.
